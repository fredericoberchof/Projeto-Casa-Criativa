# Projeto-Casa-Criativa

This is a project carried out together with a Rocketseat, based on technologies: JavaScript, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3 and SQL. Thus, the frontend, backend and database was developed to collect ideas from users to carry out activities at home, due to social isolation due to the 2020 pandemic.
